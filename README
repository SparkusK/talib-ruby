Ruby Wrapper for ta-lib (http://ta-lib.org/).

This project has been started by Timur Adigamov on Rubyforge (http://rubyforge.org/projects/talib-ruby/),
but since it didn't build on my machine and wasn't complete i modified it slightly, et voilˆ.

Install and build instructions
==============================
1. Install ta-lib from MacPorts: sudo port install ta-lib
2. Checkout talib-ruby (it includes the ta-lib directories /include and /lib from
   the MacPorts version)

3. Now run the following commands in talib-ruby:

   ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386" ruby extconf.rb --with-talib-dir=/ABSOLUTE_PATH_OF/talib-ruby

   should output 'checking for TA_Initialize() in -lta_lib... yes'
                 'creating Makefile'

   make -> creates talib.bundle

   sudo make install -> copies talib.bundle to /Library/Ruby/Site/1.8/universal-darwin9.0

4. Now ta-lib can be used by using "require 'talib'"
